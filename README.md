## Overview

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor. I have tried to create same design as on the example. This challenge helped me to understand how to locate div in the center of the page. Also I tried to write code in scss for the first time. I still have to learn more about mixins. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

So today I have learned more about Sass and how to write code with it. Also I have worked with variables, which was easier than I thought. 
I had extra practice with flex boxes. 


### Continued development

I definitely have to learn more about Sass. Also I would like to work more on positioning and flex boxes.
Overall, I think I just need more practice.

### Useful resources

During my work I just used a chatGPT for help.
